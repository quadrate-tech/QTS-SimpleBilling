# QTS-SIMPLE BILLING SYSTEM


### WHAT IS **QTS-SIMPLE BILLING SYSTEM**
---

This is a simple desktop application which was developed as a simple billing system to ensure all the requirements of billing system.

### Required Frameworks
---
A framework is a software infrastucture in which a software that provides generic fuctionality can be selectively changed by adding user-written code to it,hence providing application-specific software.

It is used to develop or run or debug the application

Once a framework is installed in the machine, we can continue the application development instead of developping it from the scratch.

According to this project, follow mentioned frameworks basically were used to develep this **Simple Billing Sytsem** more successfully.

- [.NET Frameowrk 4.8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies#net-framework-48)

.NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows. Therefore this used to develope the windows based "Billing system"

- [EF core 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)





- [Microsoft SQL Server EF Core Database Provider]()

Users of applications built with the .NET Framework need to have .NET Framework installed. In most cases, .NET Framework is already installed with Windows. If needed, you can download .NET Framework 16.8.4 latest version.

You need .NET Framework installed in order to run applications on Windows that were created using .NET Framework. It is already included in many versions of Windows. You only need to download and install .NET Framework if prompted to do so.

.NET Framework applications are written in C#, F#, or Visual Basic and compiled to Common Intermediate Language (CIL). The Common Language Runtime (CLR) runs .NET applications on a given machine, converting the CIL to machine code.

### Project Architecture

![UML class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77657271/107886283-d8b24680-6f24-11eb-8fd0-e86a89c01d4c.jpeg))

This is the UML diagram of the developed simple Billing system which include tweleve model classes with each interface which supports the user to interact with the operations using user friendly interfaces. Here basically have six main fuctions which interact with the database and contribute with eact models. Therefore whole project was implemented by inheriting the methods for each and reduce the redundency as well.


### Tools Used to Develop
---
- [Visual Studio (16.8.5)]()

Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides development productivity tools and debugging capabilities.
